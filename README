This was made very quickly and a single, once-time purpose.
Though I've used it twice (to make a Zelda map and the Minimum Braid Representative of the Perko Pair), I am not commited to redo it right now and make it actually useful.

Looking back on it, I used a lot of hackery and annoying by-hand calculations just because I was too lazy to fix them, but still patient enough to calculate ~400+ numbers to fill out a working grid.
